                        <p>Sebastian Frenkel has a longstanding connection with the 02 Series. “I was born in 1972. In
                            the same year, my father won a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Munich.” Peter Frenkel was
                            in the starting line-up for the German Democratic Republic in the 20-kilometer race walk.
                            The lead car in the walking events in Munich was an orange BMW 1602 – with an e-engine. “I
                            found that out only later,” Sebastian Frenkel says. “But it fitted perfectly with my passion
                            for the BMW 02.”.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">About Bmw</h5>
                <p class="card-text">BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, German automaker noted for quality sports
                    sedans and motorcycles and one of the most prominent brands in the world. Headquarters are in
                    Munich.

                    It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the
                    name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered
                    the automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not
                    broken until 1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the
                    Luftwaffe, Germany’s air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market
                    but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By
                    1959 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to
                    Daimler-Benz.

                    In that year, however, BMW pulled out of its financial slump; German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt
                    acquired a controlling interest in the firm, and BMW introduced its 700 series, soon followed by the
                    equally successful 1500 model. At about the same time, the company introduced a new series of
                    motorcycles that were particularly popular in the United States.


                    BMW was firmly established as a premium automobile brand by the end of the 20th century. In a failed
                    attempt to gain market share as a sport-utility vehicle company, BMW purchased the Rover Group in
                    1994 but lost roughly $4 billion before selling the Land Rover brand to Ford in 2000. BMW saw great
                    success with the relaunch of the British MINI in 2001, however, and another British brand,
                    Rolls-Royce, became part of BMW in 2003. Members of the Quandt family continued to hold a
                    significant stake in the company.</p>
